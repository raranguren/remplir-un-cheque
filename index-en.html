      <h1>How to write a cheque in France</h1>
      <section id="index">
        <p>
          Unlike other countries where they may be being phased out, cheques are
          widely used in France. French cheque book is called a «Chéquier» or a
          «Carnet de chèques», and most banks will give them for free to their
          customers. A cheque is called a «chèque», they are linked to your bank
          account, but they are only valid when filled correctly and signed by
          the owner of the bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing a french cheque is simple as long as you follow the steps
          correctly:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#step1">Enter the amount you want to pay</a></li>
          <li><a href="#step2">Enter the amount in words</a></li>
          <li><a href="#step3">Enter the payee's name</a></li>
          <li><a href="#step4">Indicate the place and date</a></li>
          <li><a href="#step5">Sign your cheque</a></li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="step1">
        <h2>
          <span class="step-number">1</span>Enter the amount you want to pay
        </h2>
        <p>
          There is a box to the right of the cheque in which you need to put the
          amount you want to pay. Leaving no space to the left, write all the
          digits. If the number has decimals, use a comma as the separator. Then
          fill the rest of the box with a horizontal line to prevent
          modifications.
        </p>
        <div class="cheque-paper">
          <span class="printed-box">
            <span
              id="remplir-cheque-numeric"
              class="handwritting handwritting-line"
              >42,00</span
            >
          </span>
          <span class="printed euro">€</span>
        </div>
        <p>You can see the examples in this page with a different amount:</p>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Handwritting simulation</legend>
          <label for="remplir-cheque-input">Amount to pay:</label>
          <input
            id="remplir-cheque-input"
            type="number"
            step="0.01"
            value="42"
          />
          €
        </fieldset>
      </section>
      <section id="step2">
        <h2><span class="step-number">2</span>Enter the amount in words</h2>
        <p>
          Below the bank logo, the first field reads
          <b>«Payez contre ce chèque»</b> , which means
          <i>«pay against this cheque»</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to input the amount in words, starting right after the above
          wording and filling the remaining space with a horizontal line.
        </p>
        <div class="cheque-paper">
          <span class="printed">Payez contre ce chèque </span>
          <span
            id="remplir-cheque-text"
            class="handwritting printed-underline handwritting-line"
            >quarente-deux euros</span
          >
        </div>
        <p class="info">
          Note that most banks accept cheques filled in other languages, even
          with numbers. However, if someone tampers with the numbers, it is hard
          to prove the forgery and this guide follows the best practices to
          avoid such scams.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="step3">
        <h2><span class="step-number">3</span>Enter the payee's name</h2>
        <p>
          The sentence above continues with <b>«à»</b>, which means <i>«to»</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to input the name of the person or company that will receive
          the payment.
        </p>
        <div class="cheque-paper">
          <span class="printed">à</span>
          <span class="handwritting printed-underline">OpenClassrooms</span>
        </div>
        <p class="info">
          Never sign a cheque without a payee's name. If it is cashed with a
          different name, you might be unable to prove that you paid a bill and
          be asked to pay it again.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="step4">
        <h2><span class="step-number">4</span>Indicate the city and date</h2>
        <p>
          Below there is space for your signature. Nearby there are two fields
          to fill in the place and date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The place is usually indicated with <b>«À»</b> or <b>«Fait à»</b>. It
          is the city where you are signing the cheque, NOT your address.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word <b>«le»</b> precedes the date of signature. Write the date in
          which you will give the cheque to the payee. Use the French format, 
          which is day/month/year, as shown below:
        </p>
        <div class="cheque-paper">
          <p>
            <span class="printed">Fait à </span>
            <span class="handwritting printed-underline">Paris</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="printed">le </span>
            <span
              id="remplir-cheque-date"
              class="handwritting printed-underline"
              >DD/MM/YYYY</span
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="info">
          Reminder: All cheques are valid for 1 year and 8 days.
           It is legally prohibited to backdate or postdate them.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="step5">
        <h2><span class="step-number">5</span>Sign your cheque</h2>
        <p>
          Before signing, detach your cheque from the cheque book. This prevents
          the signature mark on your cheque from showing up on the next cheque,
          which could allow your signature to be forged if your cheque book is
          lost or stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The signature must be the same that you registered with the bank, as
          they will be compared during the verification.
